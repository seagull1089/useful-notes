## Configs and settings to make your desktop more productive
- To make your mouse screaming fast on mac os. Found this gem after months of fidding around the forums.
```defaults write -g com.apple.mouse.scaling -float 10.0```
-  To read the default value.
```defaults read -g com.apple.mouse.scaling```
- To do the same thing for trackpad: 
```defaults write -g com.apple.trackpad.scaling -float 8.0```
