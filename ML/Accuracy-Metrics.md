## Basic Accuracy metrics
* MAE - mean absolute error. | P - R | / N
* MSE  - mean squared error. (| P - R |)**2 / N
* RMSE - root mean squared error. sqrt(MSE)
* Reversals -? 

### Look at both of these. 
- Usual Model - average over all ratings. 
- Alternative Model - average over user averages. 

## Cross fold validation. 

## Precision and Recall. 
* precision = relavant/total_returned.
* recall = relevant/total_relavant_items_overall. 
* F_1 = 2PR/(P + R).
