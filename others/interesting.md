* The reason why human beings retrieve the dead and give them a burial , 
and how singing and dancing has helped in evolution : if local predators get a taste for 
human flesh from a corpse, they'll come after the living and humans singing and dancing in unision can 
give the appearance of one large animal to scare off predators. -- http://www.meltingasphalt.com/music-in-human-evolution/

* Interesting quote:  Louis Nizer -- 
```"He who works with his hands is a laborer. He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman. He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist"```

* Don't get too lost in using the technologies, try to focus on what you want to build.
